# SuperMarket Management app

## About the project:
#### This application was written in Java.
The system includes a point of sale system also it manages employees, customer and store inventory management.

- Stock inventory is updating as items being added to receipt.
- The system uses .dat files that do not require additional software installation for the system to work.
- Code is separated between view and the "behind-the-scenes" code. 
You can change the logic of the code without changing anything in the view. (like using an API) 
- There are also Junit test files for testsing invalid input in the system.
